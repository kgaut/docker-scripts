# docker-scripts
Useful script to clone within a docker container

Please have a look to my [docker-compose.yaml](https://gist.github.com/kgaut/276b08a289f2e188f3cee9702d774339) that use theses scripts, a [Drupal runner image](https://github.com/kgaut/runner-drupal-php-5.6) and a [MySQL Image](https://github.com/kgaut/runner-mysql)
